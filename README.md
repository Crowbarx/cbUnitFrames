# Crowbar Unit Frames

> *"Are your unit frames stuck in 2006? Give them a little forceful encouragement."*

## What is this?

**Crowbar Unit Frames** is a complete, from-scratch unit frame replacement addon built for **Turtle WoW (Version 1.12)**. This entire project is **100% VIBE CODED** with the help of an AI assistant, proving that robots *do* have good taste.

Tired of the chunky, classic UI? This addon is the crowbar designed to pry the classic interface into the modern era, bringing the sleek, minimalist, and beautiful aesthetic of the amazing **ToxiUI** to your Vanilla experience.

## Features

- **A Modern Look:** A loving tribute to the clean and efficient design of ToxiUI, focusing on readability and style.
- **Player & Target Frames:** The core of any good UI, with more units to come!
- **Built for Classic:** Designed from the ground up for the 1.12.1 client, ensuring it's lightweight and performs smoothly.
- **Highly Customizable (In Progress!):** A full in-game configuration menu is being built using the powerful Ace3 framework, which will allow you to tweak every aspect of your frames.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from the 'Releases' page on GitHub.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Copy the `CrowbarUnitFrames` folder into your `Interface\AddOns\` directory.
4. Ensure the folder is named `CrowbarUnitFrames` and not `CrowbarUnitFrames-main`.
5. Launch the game and enable the addon at the character selection screen.

## Usage

The addon is currently in its early stages and will replace your Player and Target frames automatically.

To access the configuration panel (once it's complete), you can use the following slash commands:

`/cb` or `/crowbar`

## Why "Crowbar"?

Because the default UI is a locked door, and we needed the right tool to pry it open and let some modern design philosophy in.
